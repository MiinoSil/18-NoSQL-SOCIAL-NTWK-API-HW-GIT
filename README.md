## Description

MongoDB is a flexible database that works with unstructured data in large quantities and speed. This backend API is a social network web application where a user can share thoughts, react to other users' thoughts, create a friend list. It uses Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. A video walkthrough displays interaction with API using INSOMNIA.
